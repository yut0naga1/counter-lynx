[**ReactLynx**](https://lynxjs.org/react/) is a framework that allows you to build cross-platform [**Lynx**](https://lynxjs.org/) apps with [**React**](https://react.dev/) paradigm.

- **Aligned with React 17+**\
  Built on battle-tested open-source implementations, it fully supports functional components, Hooks, and Context â€” the same set of modern React APIs.

- **Made for Lynx**\
  Dual-threaded React tailor-made for Lynx, carrying over Lynx's instant launch and silky UI responsiveness.

- **Compatible with React Ecosystem**\
  With [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) and [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for state management, [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for data fetching, Fast Refresh and DevTools for React components, everything you need is here.

## Credits

Thanks to:

- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for creating a lightweight and efficient implementation of React's APIs that served as the foundation for ReactLynx runtime.
- [React](https://react.dev/) for creating a gaming-changing UI library and programming model that has inspired a generation of declarative UI technologies.
- [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/), [React Server Component](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) and [Web Worklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worklet) for inspiring ReactLynx's dual-threaded programming models such as [Main Thread Scripting](https://lynxjs.org/react/main-thread-script.html).
- [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) project created by [@kdy1](https://github.com/kdy1), which turbocharges ReactLynx's code transformation with Rust-powered efficiency, achieving sub-second build times and frictionless developer experience.
