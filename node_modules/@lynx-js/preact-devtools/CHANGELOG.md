Despite this being mostly a maintenance release, there is one new feature: "Reload and profile". This allows to capture the very first render of any application and inspect the render performance!

We couldn't resist adding a major feature too as it turned out to be easier to implement than initially assumed. The profiler is now able to inspect why a node rendered! The full support for this feature required a change in Preact. But don't worry we'll cut a new release over there in the coming days!
